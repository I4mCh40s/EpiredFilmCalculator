# Expired Film Buddy v0.1

If you're into film photography then you have probably shot an expired film before.
The main difficulty for me was to correctly interpret film's box speed (aka ISO) and shoot it properly.

# a little theory for y'all
Photosensitive chemistry degrades over time and can produce unexpected results when shot at ORIGINAL box speed

# what it does
Here's where this program comes in. Just input your film's ISO (as written on the box) and the year of expiration
and this program will spit out the necessary ISO adjustments in order to avoid unexpected results and bad photos.
